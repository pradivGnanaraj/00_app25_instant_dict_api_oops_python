**System Components:**

1. **User Interface (UI):**
   - The front-end interface built using JustPy.
   - Consists of pages like Home, Dictionary, and About.
   - Utilizes layout components for consistent styling.
   - Allows users to input words in the Dictionary page and displays definitions in real-time.
   - Implements responsive design for various devices.

2. **Backend Logic:**
   - Handles user input, queries, and interactions.
   - Utilizes classes like `Definition`, `Page`, and others.
   - Extracts word definitions from the dataset using the `pandas` library.
   - Integrates with the `Requests` library to fetch data from online sources.

3. **Data Handling:**
   - Manages word definitions using the `data.csv` file.
   - Uses the `pandas` library for reading and querying data.
   - Provides efficient data retrieval based on user input.

4. **Layout Management:**
   - Utilizes the `layout.py` module to define the layout components.
   - Implements a default layout for consistent styling across pages.
   - Manages navigation through the `QDrawer` component.

5. **Routing and Navigation:**
   - Routes different URLs to respective pages using JustPy's routing capabilities.
   - Enables seamless navigation between Home, Dictionary, and About pages.

6. **Web Server:**
   - The application runs on a local development server using JustPy's built-in server capabilities.
   - Serves the application to users on the specified port (e.g., port 8001).

**Interaction Flow:**

1. User visits the web application's URL.
2. The server initializes and serves the default Home page.
3. The user can navigate to the Dictionary and About pages using the navigation drawer.
4. In the Dictionary page, the user types a word in the input box.
5. The input event triggers a call to `get_definition` method, which fetches and displays the word's definition.
6. The user can also navigate back to the Home and About pages using the navigation drawer.

**Future Considerations:**

1. **Scalability:** As the application gains popularity, consider deploying it on a production server for broader access.
2. **User Authentication:** Enhance the application by adding user accounts, allowing users to save favorite words, customize settings, etc.
3. **Enhanced UI/UX:** Continuously improve the user experience with more visually appealing designs and smoother interactions.
4. **Backend Optimization:** Optimize data retrieval and processing to handle a larger number of queries efficiently.
5. **API Integration:** Explore integrating with external APIs for more accurate and extensive word definitions.
